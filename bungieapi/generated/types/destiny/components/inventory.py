    character has and how much of that item they have.

    Requesting this component will allow you to circumvent manually
    putting together the list of which currencies you have for the
    purpose of testing currency requirements on an item being purchased,
    or operations that have costs. You *could* figure this out yourself
    by doing a GetCharacter or GetProfile request and forming your own
    lookup table, but that is inconvenient enough that this feels like a
    worthwhile (and optional) redundency. Don't bother requesting it if
    you have already created your own lookup from prior
    GetCharacter/GetProfile calls.
