    multiple items).

    inventory, along with the values for plugs in the set. Any given set
    in this component may be represented in Character and Profile-level,
    as some plugs may be Profile-level restricted, and some character-
    level restricted. (note that the ones that are even more specific
    will remain on the actual socket component itself, as they cannot be
