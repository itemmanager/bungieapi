    icon_path: str  # The icon for the perk.
    is_active: bool  # Whether this perk is currently active. (We may return perks that you have not actually activated yet: these represent perks that you should show in the item's tooltip, but that the user has not yet activated.)
    perk_hash: int  # The hash identifier for the perk, which can be used to look up DestinySandboxPerkDefinition if it exists. Be warned, perks frequently do not have user-viewable information. You should examine whether you actually found a name/description in the perk's definition before you show it to the user.
    visible: bool  # Some perks provide benefits, but aren't visible in the UI. This value will let you know if this is perk should be shown in your UI.
