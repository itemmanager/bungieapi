IMPORTANT: This field may not return the data you're interested in for Cross-Saved users. It returns the last ownership data we saw for this account - which is to say, what they've purchased on the platform on which they last played, which now could be a different platform.  If you don't care about per-platform ownership and only care about whatever platform it seems they are playing on most recently, then this should be "good enough." Otherwise, this should be considered deprecated. We do not have a good alternative to provide at this time with platform specific ownership data for DLC.
