    """By public demand, Checklists are loose sets of "things to do/things you
    have done" in Destiny that we were actually able to track.

    They include easter eggs you find in the world, unique chests you
    unlock, and other such data where the first time you do it is
    significant enough to be tracked, and you have the potential to "get
    them all". These may be account-wide, or may be per character. The
    status of these will be returned in related "Checklist" data coming
    down from API requests such as GetProfile or GetCharacter. Generally
    speaking, the items in a checklist can be completed in any order: we
    return an ordered list which only implies the way we are showing
    them in our own UI, and you can feel free to alter it as you wish.
    Note that, in the future, there will be something resembling the old
    D1 Record Books in at least some vague form. When that is created,
    it may be that it will supercede much or all of this Checklist data.
    It remains to be seen if that will be the case, so for now assume
    that the Checklists will still exist even after the release of D2:
    Forsaken.
