    The shitty thing about this, however, is that the socket categories' UI style can be overridden by the item's UI style. For instance, the Socket Category used by Emote Sockets says it's "consumable," but that's a lie: they're all reusable, and overridden by the detail UI pages in ways that we can't easily account for in the API.

In the future, I may attempt to use this information in conjunction with the item to provide a more usable UI hint on the socket layer, but for now improving the consistency of plugSources is the best I have time to provide.
